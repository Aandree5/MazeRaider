Please follow the instructions

Steps:
1. Install Code Blocks and Xampp first. Keep Xampp on its usual path (C:\xampp).

2. Open Xampp Control Panel and click Start button for Apache and MySQL modules, wait until they start. To check if Xampp is working correctly, from your Web Browser, go to http://localhost/dashboard/ to see if Welcome text comes or not, it you see Welcome to XAMPP then its fine.

3. Next run MySQL Installer (mysql-installer-web-community-5.7.17.0.msi), and in installation process choose Custom, then add MySQL Server 5.7.17 - X86 ( not all of its components, only check the Development Components and its Client C API library ). Also add Connector/C++ 1.1.8 - X86.

4. After completing download and installation, you would be asked to write Port number in which MySQL will run. You could see the number 3306. Change it to some other number, such as 3307 (as MySQL from Xampp runs in 3306 by default).

5. On the last step here, you would see some list of procedures and Execute button, click on execute, after completing ( or getting failed to start Server ), close and finish the setup.

6. Now run Code Blocks, start a new Console Application of C++.

7. Goto Build Options -> Linker Settings tab. Add -

C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\lib\libmysql.lib
C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\lib\mysqlclient.lib

(Click No if asked for Relative Path, change the path as required if you installed the MySQL Server in some different place that mentioned above.)

8. Goto Build Options -> Search directories tab. Add these folder -

C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\include

9. Now with Explorer, goto "C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\lib", and look for the file
"libmysql.dll". Copy it and paste it in these locations :

      1. C:\Windows\System32
      2. <your code blocks project path> where you can see *.cpp and *.cbp file
      3. <your code blocks project path>\bin\debug\
